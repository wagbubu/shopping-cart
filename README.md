# Shopping Cart Project

This is one of the required project by the ReactJS course I am following in The Odin Project.
<br>
<br>
This project uses [FakeStoreApi](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to fetch all the products from it.
<br>
<br>
The project also utilizes redux to make it easier for me to handle states.
